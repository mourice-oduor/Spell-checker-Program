python program that will automatically correct spelling for you. 

# A) Spell-cheker Version_1:
 Module used here is; Textblob
# Link: https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/

This is how the program in version-1 works:
 First of all the string is extracted from the txt file then it is checked for any spelling mistake,
  if found it is corrected and overwritten onto that txt file.

This program uses file handling method to open, read and write or correct contents of the txt file. 

# B) Spell-cheker Version_2:


# C) Spell-cheker Version_2:
    This Script reads a dictionary file as a parameter and determines all the words from a text file,
     that are not included in the dictionary file.

    The program uses functions, loops, conditions, variables, lists, strings, and file input.
    For the textblob to work, it must be run on virtual environment using this version.
