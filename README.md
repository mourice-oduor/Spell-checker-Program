# Spell-checker-Program
python program that will automatically correct spelling for you. 

# A) Spell-cheker Version_1:
 Module used here is; Textblob
# Link: https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/
#       http://theautomatic.net/2019/12/10/3-packages-to-build-a-spell-checker-in-python/

This is how the program in version-1 works:
 First of all the string is extracted from the txt file then it is checked for any spelling mistake,
  if found it is corrected and overwritten onto that txt file.

This program uses file handling method to open, read and write or correct contents of the txt file. 

# B) Spell-cheker Version_2:
     This script using the 'main.py' file given on the command line and validates it if it is in the list of words given.
     Then the spellchecker.py file extension checks whether the given word is spelled correctly and returns True otherwise False.
     Both Scripts uses functions, loops, sets and dictionary together with file handling methods.

# C) Spell-cheker Version_3:
    This Script reads a dictionary file as a parameter and determines all the words from a text file,
     that are not included in the dictionary file.

    The program uses functions, loops, conditions, variables, lists, strings, and file input/handling.
    For the textblob to work, it must be run on virtual environment using this version.
    
# D)  Spell-cheker Version_4:
      Simple spell checker which loops through a given dictionary of words in key-pair values,
       then returns the correct value pair of words from the given dictionary.
